</p>

<p style="margin-left:10%; margin-right:10%;">
  <i>I will develop a webpage
    with JavaScript for a number guessing game which will consist of numbers between 1 and 10.
    Each time the program will select a random number between 1 and 10, and when a user guesses a number,
    the program will output if the target number is higher or lower than the user's guess.
    This will repeat until the user gets is correct.</i>

<button onclick="myFunction()">Press to Play!</button>

<p id="demo"></p>

<script>
function myFunction() {
  let msg;
  let num;
  //Generates a random integer between 1 and 10
  num = Math.floor(Math.random() * 11);
  let userGuess = prompt("Guess a number between 1 and 10 inclusive: ");
  if (userGuess == null || userGuess == '') {;
    alert('You exited the program, or provided an incorrect input.');
    return;
  }
  while (userGuess != num){;
    if (userGuess == null) {;
      alert('You exited the program, or provided an incorrect input.')
      return;}
  if (userGuess > num){;
      alert('Incorrect. The target number is lower than your guess!')
  }
  else {
      alert('Incorrect. The target number is higher than your guess!')
